# Graph Visualizer and Editor

This is a simple browser app for drawing [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) coded in vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no server side,
just download and open graved.html in your browser (tested in Firefox 60.0.1, macOS).

You can save/load your graph to/from JSON.

Edge weight can be any real number between 0 and 1. You can also automatically adjust weights of edges
so the sum of incoming weights to a node always equals 1.
